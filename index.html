    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am currently working as a Chemist for the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission.  I analyze finished drinking water to ensure all organic compounds of interest are below the maximum contamination limit.  Luckily the water sources used for the city of San Francisco are from a very clean source, so very minimal modification is required to maintain acceptable qualities.  I am interested in data analysis after realizing how much data I currently produce at my current occupation.  
    </p>
    <p>
    	I grew up in northern California and have spend a fair amount of time in western Massachusetts.  I attended Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo where gained a B.S. in Soil Science, focusing on Environmental Management.  My interests include motorsports, cooking, hiking and learning to code.
